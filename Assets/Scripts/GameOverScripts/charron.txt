Hello child.
Do not be alarmed.
You might be wondering, who am I, and where you are?
My name is not important. 
Let's just say I'm a friend, and you are on my boat.
We are in a place between two planes. 
My job is to ferry people between the two planes.
Oh...
I see my friend has bestowed a gift opon you.
If you give be one gold tallon. 
I could bring you back to the plane in which you came from.
You see child, I am quite a lazy fellow and my job has become quite hard as of late.
There are so many others that wait to cross and I am just one person.
So what do say, Help me help you.
