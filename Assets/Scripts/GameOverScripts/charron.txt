Hello child.
Do not be alarmed.
You might be wondering, who am I, and where you are?
My name is not important. 
Let's just say I'm a friend, and you are on my boat.
We are in a place between two planes. 
My job is to ferry people between the two planes.
Oh...
I see my friend has bestowed a gift apon you.
If you give me one Gold Tallon. 
I could bring you back to the plane in which you came.
You see child, I am quite a lazy fellow and my job has become quite hard as of late.
There are so many others that wait to cross, and I am just one person.
So what do say. Help me, help you.

	yes
Plesser doing buisness with you child...

	no 
Hmph...
Have it your way child.

	Less then 3 coins
Oh? Welcome back child...
I did not expect to see you so soon. 
If you give me one Gold Tallon. 
I could bring you back to the plane in which you came.
So what do say. Help me, help you.

	Zero coins
Welcome back child...
If you... Oh I see you are out of Gold Tallon.
I'm afraid since you're out of Tallons, I no longer have any incentive too help.
Now sit there and keep quiet.

the end
